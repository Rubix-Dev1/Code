# Hi!
This is RedGuyHatesHomework's GitHub page where my code organization and style is seen.

To navigate through my GitHub page, you'll need to use my Roblox portfolio's (redguy-luau.carrd.co) "Past work" section.

Just open on the folder which has the name of the work you're looking for, and all of the scripts are available in that folder! I recommend viewing the explorer first before viewing the scripts.
